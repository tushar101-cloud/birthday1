                I could have literally write ✍️ a lot more than you have patience to read , 
                maybe you would like to have some wise word or something like that but
                 believe me cutie even wisest words means nothing if you don't have it in you to believe and understand them
                 and I know you have that in you because you are one of the most understanding and kindest person I have ever met, 
                 you are so pure and adorable that I can't even find the right word to describe you, 
                 I just want to say thank you for being in my life and making it better with your presence, 
                 I hope this year will be as amazing as you are and that all your dreams will come true, 
                 happy birthday again cutie 🐾💖

                I don’t think you realize how calming your presence is.
                Some people exist loudly…
                but you? You exist softly.
